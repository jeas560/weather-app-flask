# weather-app-flask
A project to study flask.

After download the project, go to the directory and follow the code block:

    virtualenv -p python3 .
    source bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    flask run

I follow and modify somethings of [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWA0GgUN8kg) created by the Pretty Printed YouTube channel.
